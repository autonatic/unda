# Understanding Data Analytics

general remarks:

- remember learners of aims, keep big picture in sight
	- understand the data science landscape (to see what infrastructure / staff is needed)
	- apply data analytics to see how it works, what can be done, how it could be useful

- show were we at, summarize
- hard to justify big stacks with mickey mouse examples
- the course is acompanied with R


## about me

- why i teach this course:
	- promote open source
	- see what's needed in practice 

- all course members should introduce themselves

## Background Check 

interactive bullet chart:

- statistics
- programming
- database


## Inspiration

- what data analytics can do
	- 1 million lines of code
	- seasonal.website app (maybe also seasonal viewer, cause of internet con)
	- mobile phone 
	- choropleth maps


## Tools

- R
- Python 
- R Studio
- R Studio Server
- PostgreSQL 
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Azure
- AWS
- github
- gitlab
- Oracle
- Julia
- pandas
- numpy
- mongoDB
- Cassandra
- hadoop
- elastic



## Minimal Example Stack

- Programming Language: R Language for Statistical Computing
- IDE: R Studio (Server)

- Version Control: Git
- Database: PostgreSQL


## The R language for Statistical Computing

- Interpreted / Scripting language
- Open Source, license cost free
- well established in academia and business (Microsoft backed)
- large, vivrant community
	- more than 10'000 extension packages on CRAN
	- more than 200'000 questions on stackoverflow.com
	- various mailing lists
	- elaborate documentation
	- R Core Team


## About IDE's, editors 

- R console
- R Gui (Mac)
- Eclipse Plugin
- REPL solutions 
- R Studio


## Introduction to R Studio

- 4 Panes, follow me to get LTR workflow
- script window
- console 
- short cut cmd+enter: run selection
- short cut ctrl+1, ctrl+2: switch windows
- short cut command+D: multiple cursors @instances
- file explorer
- plot window
- .Rproj

## Basic R Objects

- vector
- matrix
- data.frame
- list

## Brackets and braces 

- **[row,col]**: Index
- **{}**: function or loop body
- **()**: function parameters

## Basic functions

- ls()
- rm()
- c()
- matrix()
- data.frame()
- list()
- head()
- tail()
- str()
- function()
- lapply()
- data()


## Getting help

- ?function name
- Stack overflow Questions tagged R


## Working on a dataset (mtcars)

1. get an idea about size and structure
	- class
	- structure
	- head / tail

2. get an idea about distribution of variables
	- summarize
	- visualize
	- test

3. inferential statistics / modelling
	- variance is information
	- model choice


## Summary I

- a scripting language is a good start
- understanding a language helps to remember syntax
- many tasks can be solved w/o database, larger stack


































## Collecting Data

- sources
	- devices (IoT)
	- social media
	- websites
